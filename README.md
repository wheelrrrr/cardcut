# Cardcut

## Why?

I want to reduce the time it takes to understand the rules of any card game.

## Mission

Most card games are simple but wordy rules are hard to read. My mission is to come up with a way to cut out the words but represent the structure and flow of the game in a visually compelling way.

## Can I help add new games?

Yes!

[Check out the simple JSON structure](_data) of the rules definition and add new games.

## Can I help improve visual depiction of each rule set?

Absolutely!

The easiest thing to do is

- clone the project
- install jekyll locally
- run locally
- make changes to [_includes/action.html](_includes/action.html) and [_includes/rules.html](_includes/rules.html)

Feedback on this project is always welcome.

Nick.
