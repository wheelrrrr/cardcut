# Cardcut

## Why?

I want to reduce the time it takes to understand the rules of any card game.

## Mission

Most card games are simple but wordy rules are hard to read. My mission is to come up with a way to cut out the words but represent the structure and flow of the game in a visually compelling way.

## Contribute

I'm very open to like minded contributers who want to help in one or more ways:

- broaden the range of games by adding new json definition files
- help develop or refine the visual structure and/or json structure

Feedback on this project is always welcome.

Nick.
